lotto generator
â€‹This program will generate unique sets of 5 numbers between 1 and 90. If any of the generated numbers have 3 matches with any previously drawn set, it will keep generating new sets until a unique one is generated. The historical data can be added to the program as a list or array of the previously drawn sets of numbers.
