lotto generator with the full Hungarian lottery historical data

​This program will generate unique sets of 5 numbers between 1 and 90. If any of the generated numbers have 2 matches with any previously drawn set, it will keep generating new sets until a unique one is generated.

DISCLAIMER: We should not be held responsible for any loss of money. Gamble responsibly I don’t guarantee any win. Most likely you will lose. Actually, even before you start playing you are already at a loss. But this script is a fun exercise. But if in case you win any money, don’t forget about me :)<br/>
